# Play

Play is a Mod4 paired project at [Turing School of Software & Design](https://turing.io/) where two students with 6 months of experience in software development, and 2 weeks experience coding in JavaScirpt create an Express API backend in vanilla JavaScript and then build out a frontend in JavaScirpt to search and return songs by music artist, favorites them and creates playlists.
